            <p class="article">
            Computer parts disposal, electronic recycling or e-waste recycling is the disassembly and separation of components and raw materials of waste electronics. This would typically include PCBs such as motherboards, power supplies, graphics cards, memory RAM sticks and harddrives. Although the procedures of re-use, donation and repair are not strictly recycling, they are other common sustainable ways to dispose of IT waste.</p>
            
            <p class="article">Electronic recycling occurs when disposing of computer parts in order to recover valuable rare earth metals and precious metals, which are in short supply, as well as plastics and metals. These are resold or used in new devices after purification, in effect creating a circular economy.</p>
            
            <p class="article">Recycling and the disposal of computer hardware is considered environmentally friendly because it prevents hazardous waste, including heavy metals and carcinogens, from entering the atmosphere, landfill or waterways. While electronics consist a small fraction of total waste generated, they are far more dangerous. If you want to dispose of computer parts, there is stringent legislation that must be adhered to and is designed to enforce and encourage the sustainable disposal of electronic devices and appliances, the most notable being the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the European Union.</p>
            
            <p class="article">Many materials used in computer hardware can be recovered by recycling for use in future production. Reuse of tin, silicon, iron, aluminium, and a variety of plastics that are present in bulk in computers or other electronics can reduce the costs of constructing new systems. Components frequently contain lead, copper, gold and other valuable materials suitable for reclamation.</p>
