            <p class="article">When it comes to computers and the environment, the main concerns come from the consequences of creating and disposing of the machine.</p>
            <p class="article">These indispensable machines have birthed a digital world of information and applications at the click of a button, revolutionizing the way individuals, societies and enterprises work, communicate and thrive. Integral to virtually every possible human activity, the benefits of computers are manifold: from creating fancy graphics to storing unimaginable amounts of data, these horse-powered tools facilitate greater productivity in businesses, government offices and households alike. No wonder that a serious look on their negative implications is upon us, as they become increasingly ubiquitous.</p>
            
            <p class="article">A United Nations University (UNU) study examines environmental impacts associated with computer production processes. The main impacts associated are believed to be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Significant energy use in the production and operation of computers.</li>
                <li>Possible long-term health effects on workers, families and neighboring communities due to chemical exposure and emissions.</li>
                <li>Possible health impacts due to exposure to hazardous materials. (The main risk of exposure is probably from computers that have been dumped in landfills or from environmentally unsafe recycling processes in the developing world).</li>
            </ul>
